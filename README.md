# AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the ROAD dataset: A Comparative Analysis for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) - CSCS at ACM CCS 2024

[[dl.acm.org]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689936.3694696)[[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17235)

This is a refactored version of the code used to produce part of the results of the paper on IDS for CAN, namely the results of the LSTM and DCNN models.

## Reproduce the results

1. Download and preprocess the datasets:
   - ROAD dataset: download it [here](https://roaddataset.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/road.zip). We used the raw CAN data, so go in the `attack/` folder and use the script you can find in `scripts/label_road.py` to parse and label the candump logs and create the csv files. The code expects to find them in the `data/road/` folder.
   - CAN dataset: download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9rwsf9pclhvv9xxloojom/AF7JeRW893grZkigkulkAHk?rlkey=gglzjap922q57acw8vfp2almh&e=1&st=b7r7855u&dl=0). Use the script `scripts/label_car-hacking.py` to create the merged and preprocessed dataset for multiclass classification. Then move every file to the folder `data/car-hacking-dataset`.
   - IVN dataset: download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/7d7zkq4h2xm9oti5u6soe/AFl055lkmYfWJQF-WhdPsgM?rlkey=k94w2yrngj6tsnj65v3krpqaa&e=1&st=9qkym9h6&dl=0). Use the script `scripts/label_in-vehicle.py` to label and merge the data in a different csv file for each vehicle. Then move the files to the `data/in-vehicle_dataset` folder.
2. Create the conda environment and activate it with the following commands:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate road_ids_cscs_2024
   ```
3. Run main.py with the needed arguments to train and test the models on the datasets, for example:
   ```
   python3 main.py --dataset road -ct binary --model DCNN --label 1
   ```
   You can find an example of bash script to run a batch of experiments in `scripts/batch_run.sh`

abstract = {The integration of digital devices in modern vehicles has revolutionized automotive technology, enhancing safety and the overall driving experience. The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is a central system for managing in-vehicle communication between the electronic control units (ECUs). However, the CAN protocol poses security challenges due to inherent vulnerabilities, lacking encryption and authentication, which, combined with an expanding attack surface, necessitates robust security measures. In response to this challenge, numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed and deployed. Nonetheless, an open, comprehensive, and realistic dataset to test the effectiveness of such IDSs remains absent in the existing literature. This paper addresses this gap by considering the latest ROAD dataset, containing stealthy and sophisticated injections. The methodology involves dataset labeling and the implementation of both state-of-the-art deep learning models and traditional machine learning models to show the discrepancy in performance between the datasets most commonly used in the literature and the ROAD dataset, a more realistic alternative.},
